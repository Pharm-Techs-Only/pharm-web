            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We may also automatically receive and store certain types of Personal Information whenever you visit the Website, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet and the IP address of the computer you are using. We may log and use your IP address to administer the Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users' webpage movements, to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We may use standard tools, such as "cookies" (which may be html files, flash files, or other technology), web beacons, or similar technologies (collectively, "Tracking Tools"). Cookies are small text files stored locally on your computer that help store user preferences. "Web beacons" or "clear gifs" are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. We may use Tracking Tools to monitor the Website and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content on the Website.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In addition, on occasion we may also set a "session cookie" on the Website to help us administer the Website. The session cookie expires when you close your web browser and does not retain any Personal Information about you after it expires. If you do not want the benefits of these cookies, you may opt-out by visiting https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. However, if you do so, you may not receive the full benefit from the use of the Website.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We may use Tracking Tools only to gather information as indicated in this Privacy Policy. In many web browsers, you can choose to delete, disable, turn off, or reject most Tracking Tools through the "Internet Options" sub-option of the "Tools" menu of your web browser or otherwise as directed by your web browser's support feature. Please consult the "Help" section of your web browser for more information. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the use of Tracking Tools as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Finally, our web servers may collect "log data." Log data provides aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other types of information you may disclose or that we may collect, including aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and other data that does not include Personal Information or from which you cannot be identified.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We may use such aggregate log data to improve access to the Website based on visitors' web browsers and operating system types to make the Website available to as many relevant users as possible. We do not link the "log data" collected to Personal Information. Third party providers may also collect aggregate log data independently from us.

              <strong>Basis for collection.</strong> We collect and process Personal Information for which you have given your express consent at the time of collection or where we have another legitimate legal basis for such collection, such as a legitimate business interest in improving our Services, to deliver Services and perform obligations under contracts we have with you, and to comply with legal obligations.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <strong>Data processors.</strong> We may retain third parties to process or analyze Personal Information we collect through our Website. For example, a site may be maintained or hosted by a third-party service provider or a promotion may be administered by a sales promotion agency.

              <strong>Profiling.</strong> We may analyze Personal Information we have collected about you to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information that is relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively. We may also use Personal Information about you to detect and reduce fraud and credit risk.

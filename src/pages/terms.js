You authorize us, or our designated third-party payment provider, to charge the credit card or other accepted payment method you designate in the amount specified in connection with the transaction. If you desire to designate a different form of payment, or if there is a change in your payment information, you must update that information with us or with our designated third party payment provider, as applicable, to reflect such change.

Further, we, or our designated third party payment provider, as applicable, may reverse certain transactions if we have a reasonable, good-faith belief that such transactions, alone or together with other transactions, are illicit, fraudulent, abusive, unlawful, or otherwise conducted in bad faith or as part of any form of unfair dealing (which could include such things as cheating, hacking, or other prohibited activity). <strong>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED IN THESE TERMS OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SALES AND PURCHASES ARE FINAL.</strong>
